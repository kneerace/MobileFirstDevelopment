                        <h2>Coffee Basics</h2>
                        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, 
                            the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. It is darkly 
                            colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in 
                            humans, primarily dur to its caffeine content.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries and is one
                             of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and 
                             presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, 
                             caffe lattte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee 
                             is a popular alternative.

                     <h3>Dates back to 800 A.D.</h3>
                       
                        <p>Legend has it that 9th-century goat herdeers noticed the effect caffeine has on their goats, who appread to "dance" after eating the fruit of the Coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with the produce and found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of cofffee was born.</p>

                    <h3>Technically seeds</h3>
                    
                    <p>Coffee beans are technically seeds. They'are the pits of the cherry-like berries found on the flowering shurbs, but we call them "beans" because of the resemblance to legumes.</p>

                <h3>Banned in the past</h3>
               
                <p>Back in 1511, leaders in Mecca believed it stimulated radical thinking and outlawed the drink. Some 16th-century Italian clergymen also tried to ban coffee because they believed it to be "satanic."
                    Howerve, Pope Clement VII loved coffee so much that he lifted the ban and had coffee baptized in 1600.
